## Foundations of Computer Operations

### What is Bash?
Bash is important because it is a command prompt that codes the computer on what to do next. We use bash in Unbuntu, so learning the commands and usage will be benificial. 

What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system? Bash has a primary job of running other applications (in the form of commands) that are installed on the same system.

How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system? When you issue a command to Bash, it searches specific directories on your system to see whether such a command exists. If the command does exist, then Bash executes it.

How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell? To determine if your system is running a Bash shell you can use the, "echo" command along with a special variable representing the name of the currently running process.

What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable? Bash is powerful and considered scriptable because anything you can type into Bash manually, you can also list in a plain-text file and have Bash run it for you. Nearly everything on Linux runs on top of the Bash shell, nearly everything on Linux can be scripted through Bash. 

Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks. Something similar for me would be the Marine Corps. I say this because you have your daily tasks laid out and its typically a routine, unless something breaks. If that happens you have the automation already in place, so customizing for those out of the ordinary instances shouldnt be a problem. In doing so it also kept the company running more efficiently.

## Things I would like to know more about
Learning the commands. I feel like there are so many its hard to keep track. However, I am slowly starting to remember and recognize some.
