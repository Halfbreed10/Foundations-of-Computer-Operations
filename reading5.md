# Ops Reading

## Foundations of Computer Operations
This is important because most of the time when using windows we will be working in a graphocal environment. There may be times when a command line is the only tool available.

How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt? You can list the files in the current directory using the "dir" command.

How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows? The sfc command stands for System File Checker, and the sfc will scan through all important files, locate any that may be damaged, and repair any of those damaged files. Using the "gpudate" command will force an update manually if the system is not responding.

What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations? Xcopy will copy multiple files and multiple directories at a single time, while robocopy has a number of unique features, including the ability to resume a file transfer if it happens to be interrupted anywhere in the middle. 

Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation. When looking for certain stats in basketball you typically have too look manually through eveyrthing. Having a file set up to where you can use dir to look at a list of differnet folders would be beneficial and less time consuming.
