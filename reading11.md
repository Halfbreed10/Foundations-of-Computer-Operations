## Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal
Understanding how to restore data and where it is stored is valuable information especially in the case of an issue arises or if you lose your data. Startup repair fixes certain problems, such as missing or damaged files that might prevent Windows form starting correctly. Lastly, secure disposal of information is paramount especially if you have sensative information or secure information that you wouldnt want to get out to the public.

What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing? Some common indicators that an SSD may be failing are bad blocks, file system repair, computer crashing, or read only mode.

How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability? SSDs do not emit audible signals like whirring, clicking, or humming when theyâ€™re approaching a complete shutdown. SSDs can operate in silence until they simply stop functioning.

What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance? Bad blocks are storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions. Some ways this may affect performance are saving, reading, and moving files may result in failure; active applications may operate slowly or frequently crash; the user may receive prompts to repair the file system; and general performance may steadily decrease, especially when handling large files. 

How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues? Power cycling can help with corruption due to a power supply issue.

How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities. This is relevant in aftermath of a natural disater becuase you could lose a lot of information and hardward depending on the disater. For example, here in Florida we have been hit by a ton a hurricanes this year. That damage it has done has knocked out power, completely put some cities underwater, or has so much damage they are still in the rebuilding process. If you had a company there and you did not have a restore point seperate from that physical location, you could end up losing everything.
