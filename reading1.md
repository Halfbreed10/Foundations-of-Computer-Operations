### How to use System Restore
This topic relates to our module becuase we are learning to restore systems and what the process is. To properly understand the material it is always helpful to have more resources.  

What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool? The Windows System Restore tool reverts to previous software, registry, and driver configuration called a restore point. It is the equivalent to "undoing" the last major change to Windows, taking your computer back to the way it was when the restore point was created.

How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows? Using the System Restore tool usually takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, at least in most cases.

How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt? open the command prompt and type the following command, "rstrui.exe". The System Restore wizard will open immediately. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the restore process

What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem? You can expand allotted storage for restore points, try running restore in safemode without networking, or use a different restore point
