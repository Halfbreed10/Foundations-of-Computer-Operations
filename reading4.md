## Foundations for Computer Operations
This is important because troubleshooting correctly is the key to solving issues. Understadning the correct procedures while troubleshooting different issues will enable you yo solve the issue in a timely manner.

What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting? If you have multiple issues at once during trouble shooting you should break them up into individual problems and then go through the trouble shooting process with each one individually.

What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?  Once youve implemented your solution, be sure to test the network. Make sure the issue is resolved, look out for other issues, and make sure to document the process.

What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base? The benefits of documenting an entire troubleshooting process are you will have a record of wha happened and how you solved it, in case the problem were to happen again. 

Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background? CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology will help in any situation that has a technical issues. For example, if my sons xbox is not working I would identify the problem by testign certain functions to see if it will power on. Once I have identified the problem I will make theories of how it happened, then I would test those theories. Upon finding with theory is the problem I would next next establish a plan to fix the xbox power source and implement the plan.
