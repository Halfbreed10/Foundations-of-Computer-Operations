## Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques

What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software? Anti-virus software primarily targets viruses transmitted through email, removable media, or network shares. While anti-malware encompasses a wider range of threats beyond traditional viruses, such as worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and other forms of malware. 

What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC? Signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infections are slower-than-usual performance, a sudden spate of pop-ups, and other anomalous issues.

Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software. The difference between a full system scan and a quick scan are that full system scans are more thorough but take longer, making them suitable for periodic deep inspections. Quick scans sacrifice some depth for speed, making them ideal for regular, faster checkups to catch common threats quickly.

What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware? If your computer is infected by ransomware you should disconnect from the network, try to find the ransomware that has affected your computer, run a malware or antivirus scan, remove ransomware, and restore your computer. Also, you should change passwords and take more security measures to stop it from happening again.

Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users? The malware removal process is fairly similar for all the operating systems. There are different tools and techniques that may be used depending on the operating systems security features, which vary between Windows, macOS, and linux.
