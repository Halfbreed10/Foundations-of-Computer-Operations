## AI and Prompt Engineering

I asked the prompt to, "Teach me how to change a tire out on an aircraft tug." AI is very interesting becuase it broke it down step by step, making sure not to leave any piece of information out. Starting with safety and ending with cleaning up the area, as well as what to do with the old tire. PSI varies depending on the tire, so the AI didnt go into the specifics of tire pressure, but instead informs you to look at the correct manual for the specific tire to ensure it is correct.
