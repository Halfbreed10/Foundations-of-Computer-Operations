## Cloud Virtualization with AWS

How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers? Virtualization has evolved beyond desktops and servers when it was popularized by VMWare in 1999 whenit was introduced to cheap Intel hardware, which allowed anyone to virtualize a traditional computer with all its resources. The same model eventually extended from desktops and servers to also cover the network, storage, data devices.

In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for? EC2 stands for "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud", which is essentially an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor. 

What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed? EC2 use storage through either Ephemeral (temporary) or Elastic Block Storage. Traffic is managed by CloudWatch monitors AWS cloud resources and how EC2 web traffic is load balanced as well as how it passes trough various security rules.

What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services? The benefits are the ability to control virtualization through a web interface, as well as to manage the entire system through API.

Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities? Virtualiaztion can promote equitable access to technology because you can put information in these virtual machines and they can be accessed from anywhere that has internet access. This could bridge the cultural gap by giving underdeveloped communities access to information they normally wouldnt. It could be life changing to some that have not caught up to these tehnologies yet.
