## Psychological Safety

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? Three key factors are trusting one another, communication, and beign supportive of one another. This will help all team members feel comfortable and that they belong in the group.

Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. When I played basketball in college our coach would try to make everything a "family" environment. We had an environment where everyone felt safe to be who they were and could take critisim from eachother without taking it the wrong way. In team meetings we would all give the coach the floor, however, he would always reiterate that the floor is open to discussion from all. Unless there was some type of personal matter that was not meant for the team to be a part of. This helped our team become very succesful , as well as build meaningful relationships that still hold value today. 

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? Teams with a high degree of psychological safety are impacted with increased collaboration, innovation, and employee engament. Team members will be happier at the job site, have a willingness to learn, and have an overall better well being.
